To run CPU code, first unzip cpu_code.zip
Then compile code with make all
This will create 4 executable files, base code, single core optimization, OpenMP, and pthread
Each of these can be run in the same way and will produce a results file
The run.sh script included gives examples of how to run the code. 

Files of particular interest are the NeuralNet versions of different optimizations.
